Welcome to your Webstone Education course ðŸ‘‹!

If you see this page, that is due to one of the following reasons:

* You haven't merged the first pull request which contains the course content
* Something went wrong and you didn't receive the course content

Let's explore these two situations to help you get started with your course.

## The first pull request is not merged

When you enrolled in the course at [webstone.app](https://webstone.app), we attempted to open a new pull request in your GitHub repository. This first pull request contains the content fo rthe course.

In orrder to see the course content here, you need to merge the pull request. To do that:
1. Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com)
1. In the **Top Repositories** section on the left, click the **Find a repository...** search input
1. Search for `webstone-education-` and click the repository that matches the course you want to study
1. Once you're on the course repository page, click the **Pull requests (1)** tab at the top
1. If you don't have an open pull request, please read the next chapter
1. If you have an open pull request, click on it to open it up
1. Click the **Merge pull request** button
1. On your local computer, navigate to the course's repo
1. Run `git pull` and navigate to [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321/)

## You haven't received the course content

Alright so this is not ideal. Our apologies that we weren't able to deliver the course. Please do reach out to us on [X](https://x.com) or via [Discord](https://discord.gg/dt583vtkeZ). We'll help you sort this out and make sure you are ready to go right away.
